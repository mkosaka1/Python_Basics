    "Python Generator functions allow you to declare a function that behaves likes an iterator, allowing programmers to make an iterator in a fast, easy, and clean way. An iterator is an object that can be iterated or looped upon. It is used to abstract a container of data to make it behave like an iterable object. Examples of iterable objects that are used more commonly include lists, dictionaries, and strings."

For an object to be an iterator it should implement the __iter__ method which will return the iterator object, the __next__ method will then return the next value in the sequence and possibly might raise the StopIteration exception when there are no values to be returned. As you can see, the process of creating iterators is lengthy and counter intuitive, which is why we turn to generators. Again, python generators are a simple way of implementing iterators.\n",
